# Budget Tracker

  ## Description
  This purpose of this project is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. Users are able to add expenses and deposits regardless of their network status. Once a network connection is established, any offline transactions will be updated. This application is hosted by Heroku and uses MongoDB Atlas for its database storage.

  Starter code for application can be found [here.](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/symmetrical-bassoon)

## Usage
This is a progressive web application and does not need to be installed. You can use budget-tracker by visiting the [link to deployed application here.](https://budget-tracks789.herokuapp.com/)
